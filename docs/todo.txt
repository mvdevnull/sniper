Issue/Bugs
1)top200 will redo some hosts in some situations.  be careful on the main TODOHOSTS as it was a complicated SQL. I think  it's getting hosts without '' blank service.info  - look there.


Speed Ideas to consider:
1) nmap -sV is slowest needs to thread or run mult hosts at a time..   (bc we are breaking down by 1 host) (confirmed db_nmap and nmap -sV same speed)

Coding Neatness to consider:
1)use functions and classes and get rid of the duplicative coding
2)sometype of debug mode -v -vv
3)convert all python.sh  to python.py


Enhancements to consider:
1)Need place to store db_nmap -oA archived.nmap.results.[date] (but only for the --top-ports=200)
2)msf cred database functionality
(need to think about the security aspect - storing password for assessment in clear text..? 
(Tie in with something relating to the nessuscmd --sshi  --wmii thingy
run a "cred -a command to add any *VALID* creds recieved from ssh login,etc"  
maybe cred -a [IPaddress] -t password -p 22 -u [user] -P [pass]  
3)remove local eth0/eth1 ip address from msfdatabase results
4)other msf aux modules to do all time -  example -- use auxiliary/scanner/ftp/anonymous on all FTP (or snmp public msf)  (there may be some aux modules for misc OS/appliance? might look for ruby code with updates to database and work that way?)
5)openscap compliance (keyed off real OS/SP etc)
6)Early dependency checking (check for python library, msfconsole, etc)

Nessus Integration (BROKEN now)
= after kicking off the nessus scan --> import the nessus scans ...
(see sniper.sh  and ./tools/sniper.rb) 
msfconsole> load sniper
---??nessus_report_list (periodically make sure nothing running)

GAPING HOLES found by msf compatable nessus plugins (BROKEN now)
This code and ideas are in the MAGIC CVE section of sniper.sh and within cve_update in sniper.py


=========================

----------------
sniper.py
--------------

LOGIC BUG:
1)UNIX is commented out but would need to do it later on at end if at all.

(-) make compatabile with python 3.x  (now only python 2.7) Convert to python3, change dependency ,etc

(-) report findings section
=detect 3.2.1.42 GEN001120 - FAIL rshd.config
=detect 3.2.1.38 GEN001020 - FAIL & root <> console
=plugin 38153, good summary of missing patches(but has to use nessucmd cuz msf db_import doesn't capture)
=how to check last bigfix update done ? 1)NASL like EPO?  2)nessucmd- policy like custom wireshark -> get file -> etc
=maybe id=35730 not ilke %virtual% -- helps find USB devices which could show up as unapproved USB devices?

(-) Confirm credential issues
(need to test all combinations and list definitively)
=good vs not good ssh - if 11936 and method = ssh, then good  (note 21745 is false positive)
=plugin 21745 - cred problem - (works win2k8R2 (UAC enabled) what does it do in linux ssh
=plugin 24786 - you logged in, but without administrator priv's
=???X)possibly something to be smarter about credential issues  (use nasl -t IP ./third-pary/nessus/smbshell.nbin)

#Future Tools (not needed yet, but maybe at some point)
#Third-Party Tools (supplied within the sniper ./third-party-tools directory , but may want to update as needed)

Future (Low Priority - if any)
---------
===============================
(-)(new code)--gaping HOLE from darkoperator finding??
see here -->  #~/scripts/sniper/third-party-tools/auto_exploit*
setup git to get new stuff from darkoperator
# msf> load auto_exploit
# msf> vuln_exploit -m
#   <here's your gaping holes?>
# msf> unload auto_exploit ### for safety
====================================

Do some logic for Account Credential issues
=1)See parse_nessus_xml.v19.pl  (specifically in section where it lists accounts)
=2)NSS-10860 will get local accounts
=3)NSS-10399 will get domain accounts (may need to change nessus scan policy with ENDUID > 1200)
