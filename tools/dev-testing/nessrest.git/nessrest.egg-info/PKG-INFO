        * Logins
        
          ```python
          scan = ness6rest.Scanner(url="https://nessusscanner:8834", login="username", password="password")
        
          creds = [credentials.WindowsPassword(username="administrator", password="foobar"),
                   credentials.WindowsPassword(username="administrator", password="barfoo"),
                   credentials.SshPassword(username="nessususer", password="foobar")]
        
          scan.policy_add_creds(credentials=creds)
          ```
        * Build policies
        
          ```python
          scan.upload(upload_file="file.audit")
          scan._policy_add_audit(category="Windows", filename="file.audit")
          scan.policy_add(name="Scripted Scan", plugins="21156")
          ```
        
        * Launch scans
        
          ```python
          scan.scan_add(targets="192.168.0.1")
          scan.scan_run()
          ```
        
        * Schedule scans
          ```python
          scan.scan_add(targets="192.168.0.1", start="YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS")
          ```
        
        * Parse scan results
        
          ```python
          scan.scan_results()
          ```
        
        * Download KB for target
        
          ```python
          kbs = scan.download_kbs()
        
          for hostname in kbs.keys():
              f = open(hostname, "w")
              f.write(kbs[hostname])
              f.close()
          ```
        
        * Output for ticketing/wiki format
        
        ### Feature Requests:
        
        * Deleting of a schedule
        * Ability to change "tag" from CLI via config/CLI arg
        * Enforce supported versions of Nessus
        
        ### Notes:
        * Proxies are not supported, although transparent proxies should work... transparently
        
        # nessrest - an example client
        
        ### Suggested installation:
        
        * Find the path to your "site-packages" with: `python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"`
        * Symlink `ness6rest.py` in the Git repo in the "site-packages" or "dist-packages" directory.
        * Test by issuing `import ness6rest` inside the Python interactive
          interpreter.
        
        ### Specifying a ca\_bundle
        
        If you are using a corporate or self-signed SSL certificate, you can specify the path to a ca\_bundle to use for verification by passing it to the Scanner initializer:
          ```python
          scan = ness6rest.Scanner(url="https://nessusscanner:8834", login="username", password="password", ca_bundle="/path/to/ca_bundle.pem")
          ```
        
        If you are using the ness\_rest client, you can pass this path on the command line using the --ca\_bundle option.
        
        ### Self-signed certificates
        
        If you're running Nessus with a self-signed certificate, and you wish to disable SSL certificate checking, you can pass insecure=True to the Scanner initializer:
          ```python
          scan = ness6rest.Scanner(url="https://nessusscanner:8834", login="username", password="password", insecure=True)
          ```
        
        If you're using the nessrest example client, it has an --insecure option that will do this.
        
        Note that this will disable invalid SSL cerficate errors and should be used with caution.
        
        ### Configuration file:
        
        * Copy `ness_rest.conf.example` to `ness_rest.conf` and configure for your scanner.
        * There are several valid paths for the location of the config file(in order):
        * The path passed from the CLI with `--config`
        * A permanent config file is searched for in the following locations:
            * `$HOME/.ness_rest.conf`
            * `$HOME/.ness_rest/ness_rest.conf`
            * `/etc/ness_rest.conf`
            * `/etc/ness_rest/ness_rest.conf`
            * `$PWD/ness_rest.conf`
        
        ### Building modules:
        
        * To build a package to install via `pip` or `easy_install`, execute:
            * `python setup.py sdist`
        * The resulting build will be in `$PWD/dist/nessrest-<version>.tar.gz`
